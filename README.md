 🚗 CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction 

  Data Analysis | Machine Learning | Regression Modeling*

 

 📌 **Project Overview

The used car market in India is highly dynamic, with prices fluctuating due to several factors such as vehicle make, model, mileage, age, condition, and market demand.
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of a used car based on its features.

The model is trained on real-world data of cars listed on CarDekho.com, enabling sellers, buyers, and market analysts to make more informed decisions.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The used car market in India experiences high price variability due to:

* Make & model differences
* Mileage and usage
* Vehicle condition
* Market supply and demand

This makes accurate price prediction challenging for sellers and buyers.

## 🧠 Solution Approach

We propose to develop a regression-based machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices based on their attributes.

### Steps Included:

1. Data loading & cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
5. Model evaluation
6. Deployment-ready pipeline (optional)
